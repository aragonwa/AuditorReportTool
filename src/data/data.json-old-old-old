This report closes out KCAO's oversight effort. The project team successfully delivered the approved scope, resulting in highly positive feedback from key stakeholders and building tenants. Additional revenue and project savings enabled them to provide more than $14.6 million in scope enhancements improving the efficiency of the building for tenants.Wright-Runstad successfully met all of the development agreement schedule milestones. However, move-in delays occurred for some individual tenants.Proactive cost control and budget management resulted in project savings. The forecast cost at completion for the project is $188.7 million including scope enhancements paid for by savings and additional revenue.  --The County Executive should review existing policies, procedures, and standard contract language for GC/CM projects and revise them as needed to guard against cost risks like those experienced during the initial project.--FMD should work with the PAO and council to streamline the county's lease approval process in order to be more competitive in the marketplace without unduly sacrificing risk control.--FMD should document its practices for managing 63-20 public-private partnership projects and develop strategies to transfer the specialized knowledge of experienced project management personnel to other project managers in FMD and other divisions new to this funding method.",

WTD plans to satisfy all mitigation obligations with some cost savings potential. We recommend that the County Executive provide timely notice to the County Council when final resolution of the Central Tunnel litigation occurs, and that WTD quantify the resultant changes, if any to its lifetime project cost. We recommend that WTD proceed with close out of all mitigation obligations before the end of 2015, working to keep expenditures at or below current forecasts and realize potential savings.",

            "Highlights": "This review evaluates the effectiveness of the structure, process and ability to meet expected outcomes of the Countywide Community Forums (CCF) as established by Ordinance 15896 and implemented as a new public engagement program between 2007 and 2011. Although CCF's operations were discontinued at the end of 2011, the CCF experience offers valuable lessons on developing and maintaining a public engagement program within King County. We evaluated the Countywide Community Forums program from the standpoint of meeting the intent of its mandates, providing value to the participants and King County, and addressing the expectations of public engagement programs as outlined in the research. The following findings emerged from the evaluation: --While the ordinance was useful in initiating the program, laying out the vision and ensuring some sustainability for the program, some specific requirements limited flexibility in its implementation. --Reaching out to participants and keeping them involved was a challenge that required a host of innovative strategies. However, those who participated were generally satisfied with the ease of access to the forums and the quality of the experience, as well as the length, content and even-handedness of the videos and surveys. --The small forum format is recognized as highly conducive to good deliberation and information gathering but was difficult to organize and sustain. Larger forums and on-line participation allowed the forums to reach wider and larger audiences. --The reports were well received by policy-makers and other county stakeholders, although to a limited audience. Time pressures constrained the depth of the analysis and customization of their content. --While the existence of a steering committee was viewed as useful, the composition as mandated by the ordinance was challenging. --The program was expensive to support on a per-survey basis, but external funding was sufficient for three years and allowed for the proper functioning of the program. However, the funding's origin, from a single source, gave the appearance of influence over the program's operation and results. --We cannot say with certainty that the program was effective. There are several aspects that were identified as working well, such as providing the public an opportunity to participate in learning more about King County. Many participants came from groups or communities that normally do not have that opportunity. Other results are more difficult to demonstrate, such as the forums impact on public policy-making.--There is much that the program sponsors, county officials, volunteers and other stakeholders can highlight to illustrate value of their investment in this unique public engagement program. At this time, CCF is no longer funded or operational. However, King County continues to pursue its public engagement strategic goal. This includes advancing equity and social justice. In that context, we offer the following observations or ideas. Consideration of these observations is dependent on the purpose and breadth of the public engagement effort. --Establish the framework and intent for a public engagement approach in legislation; an implementation plan could be subsequently submitted for review --Build upon the outreach approaches that allow for a broad representation of King County's diversity --Keep an advisory committee small and representative --Incorporate a feedback mechanism between the public and public officials --Keep communication materials focused, objective, interesting and brief --Select timely topics and strive for balanced and unbiased portrayal of issues --Provide the public sufficient information to form an opinion --Incorporate the engagement process into the county's decision-making deliberations --Provide online and in-person participation opportunities, weighing the pros and cons of options --Provide training and facilitation to participants",

            "Highlights": "The county's goal has been to accurately forecast and budget for the jail population to be served and when possible, assist other jurisdictions that need jail beds and charge these jurisdictions a fair price to recoup costs and ensure that the county will have enough beds to serve its own immediate and future needs. Balancing these goals has proven to be a difficult task. County elected officials are seeking ways to avoid reducing vital services by first finding savings through efficiencies. Over the past few years the county-responsible inmate population has been declining. Jail costs are continuing to rise while the inmate population has declined substantially. At the same time, the county is at risk of losing $19 million in revenue annually if cities continue to reduce their use of the county's excess jail beds. Our report indicates how this risk can be mitigated, and how the county can increase its revenues and lessen the burden on county taxpayers, if the goal of reducing jail costs can be achieved. Options contained in this report have a wide range of potential cost impacts in the millions of dollars, achieved through operational efficiencies and additional jail revenue. We identify a range of options to explore to achieve substantial cost savings, and we encourage jail management and staff to offer other ideas. The key recommendation of this report envisions collaboration of county policy-makers and leadership, and continued engagement with the cities of King County to provide affordable inmate housing in the county's jails. Overall, the audit suggests that a comprehensive strategic and financial plan for jails is needed to ensure the county is managing the jails in an operationally sound and financially sustainable manner. Such a plan should provide a range of alternatives to consider as well as estimates of their potential fiscal impacts.",

            "Highlights": "King County Metro Transit is a large and complex organization that serves more than 100 million riders annually within a 2,134 square-mile area. With an annual operating budget of nearly $600 million, Transit operates and maintains a bus fleet of over 1,300 vehicles. The recommendations in this report have the potential to achieve annual cost savings in the range of $30 to $37 million and to boost revenue by as much as $54 million per year. Added to this is a one-time draw down of $105 million in excess fund balance. Overall, the audit found that Transit is actively engaged in fulfilling its stated mission. Transit's approach to fulfilling its mission has contributed to higher expenditures - a situation exacerbated by reduced revenues and increased costs. Transit has multiple opportunities to improve its use of planning and analysis to reduce costs, generate revenues, and achieve its objectives. We reviewed eight areas of Transit and made specific findings and recommendations across the system. The eight areas include: Service Development, Financial and Capital Planning, Staffing, Paratransit, Trolley Replacement, Vehicle Maintenance, Transit Fares, and Data/Documentation. Throughout the report, our recommendations are intended to shift Transit's organizational perspective more toward cost reduction and revenue enhancement by operationalizing an approach that includes systematic planning and effective data analysis.",

There is no countywide summary of capital improvement program priorities. While we located a list of criteria considered by each agency, we found limited information on how these criteria are used to inform which projects are included in capital budget requests. We did not find information on why certain projects move forward to a budget request while others do not. This makes it difficult to monitor agency progress meeting their capital program goals.

In addition, the county needed to vacate SMT because, as of March 2007, the data center was in a month-to-month lease, which created schedule urgency for the Data Center Relocation Project. This situation was the result of actions taken by the executive changing the lease expiration date from March 2009 to March 2007. The lead agency model was largely successful for this project, but closer coordination between the Facilities Management Division (FMD) and the Office of Information Resources Management (OIRM) could have improved project schedule and cost outcomes. Early attention to project elements on the critical path is important to lessen schedule risks. OIRM gained valuable experience, which should help with future server relocations. Consistent reporting of staff labor charges is recommended to provide a more accurate assessment of capital project costs. The executive should provide advance notice to council before exercising lease options involving significant potential cost, schedule, or operational impacts. The executive's process for lease transactions should be strengthened. The executive should establish policies to ensure consistent budgeting and reporting of the staff labor costs on capital projects, including costs for staff funded by agency operating budgets. The executive should evaluate the adequacy of its policies and procedures for authorizing lease acquisitions and amendments.",

An analysis by jail security system experts reported that the existing security system needed to be replaced in order to avoid catastrophic failure with significant public safety repercussions. This report provides a post project review of the Integrated Security Project to enhance the security and operations of the King County Correctional Facility. To be most useful, a project review and lessons-learned exercise should focus on what worked well on a project as well as what did not work so well. From an operational standpoint, the ISP security system upgrade has been a success. Other major successes and innovations include the following: --Reassessing and terminating the predecessor project was a difficult but necessary decision. -- Adding other remodeling and major maintenance projects to the ISP enabled the county to complete those improvements while floors of the jail were vacated. -- Some of the added remodeling projects were identified in the OMP and designed to provide jail operational efficiencies. -- Executive-initiated and council-mandated independent oversight provided analysis and recommendations that proved valuable in improving the escorting and inmate relocation plan, resulting in a lower cost approach. -- Implementation of project management improvements recommended in 2007 improved communication and accountability for the remainder of the construction period. FMD should review the lessons learned from the PMA report and consider modifications to division policies and procedures that would incorporate recommendations applicable to their wide range of projects, and that would enhance successful project delivery. Those areas for consideration include: --Project execution plans that clearly spell out communication protocols and the roles and responsibilities of all key participating agencies. --Criteria for selecting an appropriate delivery method for a specific capital project. --Management of and monthly reporting of actual capital and operations costs (if applicable) compared to a baseline budget.--For major projects, plan for adequate resources and require an estimating methodology for tracking and forecasting schedule and budget, such as earned value analyses. --Completing project close out in a more timely manner.",

Recent budget cuts have resulted in cuts to FMD custodial staffing and corresponding changes to the level of service provided to FMD's customers. FMD customers are concerned about the level of cleanliness and transparency of the services they receive. FMD does not measure the amount of work needed to clean county buildings, assign custodial staffing based on workload, or have productivity standards for employees. Consequently, staffing levels may be inconsistent among buildings, and the cleanliness of buildings can vary. FMD does not have a meaningful system for measuring custodial employee performance. The level of satisfaction among FMD's customers varies, with higher satisfaction among customers located in outlying buildings, and lower satisfaction among customers located in the downtown core. FMD's custodial costs are higher than those in the private sector, but this is primarily attributable to higher compensation paid to FMD custodians rather than a lower level of efficiency. We recommend that FMD: --Conduct a formal assessment of workload that includes an inventory of tasks by area and an analysis of hours required to complete all tasks. --Develop base service levels that reflect the staffing resources assigned to individual tenants. --Improve communication with tenants and use of tenant feedback. --Continue to improve approach to assigning and supervising custodians in downtown buildings. --Implement a meaningful employee performance evaluation process and ensure supervisors conduct evaluations consistently.",

            "Highlights": "In the past 10 years, Transit has spent nearly $1 billion on bus purchases and maintenance ($342 million on bus purchases and an additional $653 million on bus maintenance). Transit's current fleet consists of more than 1,350 active vehicles, including transit vans, buses, and trolleys; and over the course of our audit, Transit ordered or put into service an additional 325 buses, while retiring or planning to retire a similar number. Both the size of the financial investment and the significance of the service provided by Transit emphasize that an effective bus procurement program--one that ensures Transit buys the right buses, at the right price, and at the right time--is critical to Transit's operational and financial success. Neither Transit nor other public transit agencies we surveyed use performance measures to track the effectiveness of their bus buying programs. Our evaluation identified three overarching findings. First, Transit has been generally successful in purchasing similar buses at lower cost than other transit entities we surveyed. Second, Transit could strengthen its bus quality assurance efforts. Third, Transit has information to develop baseline timeliness performance measures; however, Transit cannot demonstrate that buses they have purchased have been put into service in a timely fashion. We also found three areas where procurement planning and practices could be strengthened. First, Transit does not yet have a comprehensive, documented method to determine if the fleet mix they have purchased has resulted in the lowest total cost of fleet ownership. Second, Transit's bus procurements are not specifically guided by Transit or county priorities and do not optimize the investment of resources. Third, we found that during bus procurement, roles and responsibilities were sometimes unclear and did not fully facilitate achievement of Transit goals. Finally, we found that the approach to and guidance for bus quality assurance inspections is incomplete and out of date. We make six recommendations to Transit: First, develop a prioritized set of strategic procurement goals to guide procurement processes and decisions. Second, update procurement policies and procedures. Third, conduct and document annual retrospective processes to calculate and evaluate procurement performance measures and should develop action plans to improve outcomes. Fourth, fully analyze the costs and benefits of an array of fleet alternatives that could deliver the potential range of future service and meet strategic goals before making final procurement decisions. Fifth, for each bus procurement, Transit should estimate and compare the full cost and anticipated benefits of utilizing Transit staff to conduct on-site bus inspections versus contracting out this service and document the decision. Finally, Transit should update its inspection policy and procedure.",

SRRMF was intended to construct a new facility at a King County (County) owned property in Ravensdale to consolidate operations from the Road Services Division's (RSD) Black Diamond and Summit Pit road maintenance facilities to increase operational efficiency and reduce costs. Project funding was to come from the proceeds of selling the Summit Pit site. The County Executive (Executive) cancelled the SRRMF project in March 2012 after determining it could not negotiate an acceptable price for the property. The Executive forecasts it will spend approximately $4.4 million on SRRMF. This includes packaging the preliminary design and permitting work already completed for future use. Approximately $2.9 million was spent on other RSD projects in anticipation of Summit Pit sale revenue. Three hundred sixty-thousand dollars was spent on the effort to sell Summit Pit. The project team used a quantitative tool developed by FMD to evaluate delivery methods for SRRMF. This is a best practice supported by the Auditor's Office and could be adapted for use by other County agencies considering alternative delivery methods. The Executive's effort to solicit private developer interest in delivering the SRRMF project demonstrated this alternative delivery method could be feasible for a maintenance facility and site work project like SRRMF. The proposals also indicate some potential for capital project cost savings over the traditional design-bid-build delivery method. In coordination with the Facilities Master Plan, RSD should explore the timing of combining the Black Diamond and Summit Pit maintenance operations, and the Executive should review the value of retaining the Black Diamond site for emergency response and other County uses.",

We found several things related to workload and staffing: that sheriff response times have improved countywide, overtime use to cover patrol posts has increased, there are few monitoring and reporting systems to provide information on workload, performance, and staffing needs. Related to staffing cost growth, we found that the 2008 CBA accelerated the growth of staffing costs. The fiscal note transmitted with the CBA to County Council underestimated the fiscal impact of the agreement.

The purpose of the audit was to assess whether the rate proposal submitted by King County's Solid Waste Division (SWD) of the Department of Natural Resources and Parks would be feasible within a sustainable financial plan, and to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the transfer station capital improvement projects which directly influences disposal rates. On the whole, the SWD's financial plan is comprehensive, sound, and based on reasonable financial assumptions. We identify options for cost savings and revenue enhancement. Related to transfer station project costs, we determined that the transfer system plan was developed through an iterative and collaborative process; regional decisions on service levels and similar decisions made through that planning process have, in some cases, increased costs. These decisions contributed to King County's transfer stations having higher capital costs per ton, in general, than those of other jurisdictions we surveyed. There is additional time for further review of the decisions that have increased costs and may increase solid waste rates into the future. The current, estimated remaining (post 2011) capital expenditures related to these three stations is $220 million. We make four recommendations in this report. The most important of these is that SWD should update transfer system and individual facility plans as they have indicated their intention to do. During this process, SWD should provide county policy-makers and regional partners systematic analysis of the incremental cost impacts of the number and capacities of the transfer stations, the functionalities of the stations, and an assessment of which project financing and delivery method is most likely to result in lower capital costs. We make three other recommendations related to using appropriate economic assumptions, life-cycle cost analysis, and long-term investment strategies.",

The audit also included a review of national best practices for managing citizen-initiated and internally-generated police misconduct and use of force complaints. Significant issues with KCSO's policies for investigating and documenting complaints, and inconsistent adherence to those policies among KCSO units undermine organizational and individual accountability. KCSO's inability to enforce its procedures for complaints and policy violations was also inconsistent with the Commission on Accreditation of Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA) standards or best practices.Significant challenges were also identified in implementing OLEO as aneffective civilian oversight function under the current organizational andlegal framework. For example, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)interpreting the King County and Police Guild collective bargaining agreement (CBA) contains a provision that allows for the termination of theOLEO Director as a possible remedy if the arbitrator rules that the directorhas violated any part of Article 22--Civilian Oversight provisions of the CBA. We recommend that KCSO develop more detailed policies that outline the exact investigation and reporting processes for all complaints. These processes should become the standard that are categorically adhered to by officers and supervisors.

            "Synopsis": "This audit of the Sheriff's Office Internal Investigations and Office of Law Enforcement Oversight (OLEO) functions is the first in a series of annual audit reports mandated by the County Council in Ordinance 16511.Conducted in conjunction with a national law enforcement consulting firm, Hillard Heintze LLC, the purpose of this audit was to evaluate the current state of the Sheriff's Office internal investigation operations and practices, and assess the effectiveness of OLEO in providing council-directed oversight of the IIU. The audit also included a review of national best practices for managing citizen-initiated and internally-generated police misconduct and use of force complaints.<br/>We recommend that KCSO develop more detailed policies that outline the exact investigation and reporting processes for all complaints. These processes should become the standard that are categorically adhered to by officers and supervisors. We also recommend that OLEO, in collaboration with KCSO, continue planning and developing working guidelines and measurable objectives to assure that the effectiveness and benefits of law enforcement oversight are maximized in King County."

These projects include parks capital projects and facilities rehabilitation and care of county facilities. Effective delivery of projects results in benefits to county residents and efficient expenditure of county resources. We found that FMD's development of initial project scope, schedule, and cost estimates lack rigor resulting in unrealistic or incomplete budget requests. We also found that workload planning methods may over-schedule project managers. As a result, projects planned for completion in the calendar year often carry over and require resources in the next year or beyond. FMD does very limited monitoring of budget versus actual project costs. Finally, FMD lacks meaningful performance measures for effective management of project delivery. We make three recommendations to facilitate a more robust accountability framework for capital project delivery. First, ensure a more rigorous planning process focusing on establishing baseline scope, schedule, and budget. Second, establish meaningful performance measures. Third, develop and apply standards to ensure that estimates are consistent with best practice for appropriation requests.",

The purpose of the audit was to assess the effectiveness of the King County Office of Risk Management (ORM) in claims management, processing, and other administrative functions, and in preventing and reducing losses and protecting King County's assets by identifying and addressing potential risks and liabilities. We also reviewed the effectiveness of the County's overall approach to risk management. ORM is aware of best practices in integrated risk management and has proposed the County adopt an enterprise risk management (ERM) approach to proactively identify and address risks. However, in comparing ORM's ERM plan with a recognized risk management standard, ISO 31000, we found critical weaknesses within the plan. In addition, we identified auto accidents as a major area of claims against the County, finding that the County could improve its driver training systems, both for Metro transit drivers and for other frequent non-transit drivers of county vehicles.While ORM manages overall claims administration in a timely and professional manner, ORM lacks solid performance measures to assess and improve effectiveness in claims management. ORM's current Cost of Risk index understates county liabilities by not including workers' compensation costs. We recommend that ORM, in consultation with the County Executive, develop a work plan for an integrated risk management framework for the County, allowing the County to realize the benefits of ERM in reducing future claims. We also recommend that ORM track vehicle accident data for non-transit vehicles and develop performance targets for such accidents, as well as improve its internal performance measures and include workers' compensation costs in its Cost of Risk calculations. Finally, we recommend that ORM work with Metro Transit Division and Office of Safety and Claims to improve driver safety training programs for both transit and non-transit county drivers.",

This report describes the extent to which the County optimizes technology spending to leverage results with transparency, accountability, and alignment with best practices. Recent actions show measurable progress; however, further improvements are needed in King County's approach to IT investment as many current plans and practices could benefit from additional rigor and strategic focus. For example, the County recently consolidated its IT structure and transitioned to a service-based budgeting model, potentially improving transparency. However, in many cases we found that informal methods of IT project selection; significant schedule extensions; undefined business benefits; and unmitigated risks still hamper optimum IT investment. Further, we identified deficiencies in information provided to County Council as they are making project funding decisions. For example, IT project documents are often incomplete and contain unreliable data. Finally, we found that the County does not know if completed projects realized intended benefits. However, the County recently applied greater focus on benefits realization planning and our report provides recommendations supporting this effort. Our recommendations are provided both to encourage improved performance and accelerate the achievement of actions already in progress. As is often the case, implementing improvements may require time and resources. A coordinated effort between PSB and KCIT will transition the County from an incomplete approach to investing in IT to ensuring that technology spending provides benefit to the County and the taxpayers. We have recommendations in three areas:1.A framework to ensure strategic and transparent IT investment governance and independent oversight;2.Rigorous, complete, and transparent IT project selection; and3.Effective systems to collect and analyze project information with a strong focus on ensuring realization of project benefits.",

            "ProjectNum": "201203",
            "Highlights": "The federal Clean Water Act, as administered by the state Department of Ecology (Ecology), requires municipalities to control overflows from combined sewer systems. Ecology requires that King County achieve compliance with its control standards by 2030. In June 2012, the County Executive submitted an updated plan for achieving control of overflows at an estimated cost of $711 million (2010 dollars). The County Council requested this audit to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Control Plan. The Wastewater Treatment Division's (WTD) planning process for the CSO control program is professional, thorough and transparent. Nevertheless, we found several areas for improvement.Project Costs: The $711 million estimate to achieve CSO control is a planning-level estimate with a wide range of uncertainty. Based on performance of past projects, the actual cost is likely to exceed the $711 million estimate. We have identified areas which could reduce the ultimate cost of the CSO control program, including a more thorough analysis of using green stormwater infrastructure as an alternative to gray infrastructure, improvements in life cycle cost analysis, and using rate incentives to reduce the volume of stormwater entering the system.Project Effectiveness: The sequencing of projects in the proposed CSO Control Plan does not take into account the effectiveness of the various projects in reducing pollution. We found that some of the projects necessary to control CSOs achieve control at a far lower cost per gallon of discharge than others. This report provides an illustration of how re-sequencing control projects could remove an additional 3.5 billion gallons of CSO discharge, with about the same impact on rates as the sequence in the currently proposed plan. This kind of information can be of value to county policy-makers, and can be used as a way to quantify the opportunity costs of choosing one sequence of control projects over another. Our recommendations are intended to increase the cost-effectiveness of the CSO control program by:--Improving the planning and implementation of green infrastructure projects.--Improving how life cycle cost analysis is used to select projects among alternatives, and revisiting alternatives if there is a significant change in the cost of the selected alternative.--Providing rate incentives for customers to reduce their use of the system.Considering the effectiveness of the projects in removing pollution when sequencing projects.",

Our objectives were to (1) evaluate the functionality and efficacy of a tool developed to assess risk of cost, scope, or schedule overruns, (2) evaluate the extent to which agencies responsible for selected capital projects are implementing new requirements related to project scoring, management, and reporting, (3) identify any benefits to agencies, the County Council, the County Executive, and/or Capital Projects Oversight of the new scoring and reporting requirements, (4) identify any challenges and/or costs associated with implementing these requirements, and (5) briefly assess the project phase descriptions and data requirements for appropriation and lease requests for lease-based projects. This was a limited non-audit review. Key audit findings included: --The risk scoring tool functions well and meets specifications, but correlation to project performance remains unproven-- Most agencies do not use earned value management and some required reports were not filed, but agencies are otherwise ready to comply with requirements--The ordinance benefited the County Council and County Executive by providing mechanisms for oversight and encouraging countywide project management improvements--The risk scoring process and requirements for selected projects have resulted in minimal cost increases so far--Requirements for lease-based projects codify current practices. To further assess and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the requirements in Ordinance 16764, we recommend the following three actions:1.As part of their programmatic work, CPO should conduct additional analysis as more data become available to monitor the effectiveness of the ordinance.2.The County Executive should conduct further assessment of and training on best uses of Earned Value Management in managing the county's capital projects.3.The County Council and County Executive should ensure agencies are aware of the process for removing closer scrutiny and mandatory phased appropriations from projects where updated scores show substantially diminished risk.",

We found that project management in WLRD has matured since they implemented a Project Management Manual in 2012. Yet weaknesses in risk management and lessons learned processes remain and may have contributed to schedule delays of a year or more. Project risks were not well identified or monitored, especially related to budget and schedule. WLRD conducts risk assessments in early project stages. However, as risks emerge and change over the life of projects, WLRD has not consistently monitored those risks or their impact on budget or schedule. In addition, WLRD has not systematically reported performance on baseline schedule and budget versus actual. This diminishes focus on project outcomes and reduces accountability to decision-makers. Finally, WLRD has not established necessary processes to consistently capture the full benefit of lessons learned practices. This increases the risk of repeating mistakes and lessens the likelihood of capitalizing on successes from project to project. We make recommendations to support achievement of county strategic goals that focus on comprehensive risk assessment and management, enhanced attention to schedule and budget, and ensuring that lessons learned are collected and incorporated into new projects.",

We discuss how RSD's Strategic Plan for Road Services 2014 Update guides the future use of resources for pavement preservation in the face of growing financial challenges. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of RSD's pavement preservation program by comparing King County's performance to four other western Washington counties and identify strategies used by these counties for RSD to consider. RSD's spending on pavement preservation has been in alignment with its tiered maintenance strategy since 2012. Funding constraints will have negative impacts to users and the condition of King County roads. RSD's Strategic Plan for Road Services 2014 Update identifies the need to change priorities as they manage risks of a declining road system due to current and forecast financial challenges. The plan update includes new strategies that could guide RSD's actions to more cost effectively use limited pavement preservation funds. Peer counties use a variety of tactics to achieve their pavement management goals despite road revenue constraints. We identify five strategies that contribute to peer success and may provide promising opportunities for King County as it makes changes to its pavement preservation program. 1.Strategic use of pavement seals 2.

            "Highlights": "This audit compares the costs of the current program with a pooled or shared vehicle system. More than thirty years ago the King County Sheriff's Office (KCSO) instituted a take-home vehicle program that assigns each officer a vehicle to use for both commuting and while on-duty. It currently spends more than $7 million annually to operate its vehicle fleet. We found that changing the program entirely, by moving KCSO from its existing take-home vehicle program to a pooled vehicle program, would not result in cost savings given KCSO's current structure and organization. However, there are some patrol areas (e.g., some zones and contract cities) and non-patrol functions (e.g., detectives and command staff) where the current program is more expensive and where savings are possible.We also found that while officers are allowed to use their assigned vehicles for off-duty work, KCSO does not track the magnitude of this work nor does it have a system in place to ensure the County is reimbursed for the use of its vehicles. Another way the costs of the take-home program to the County could be reduced is through cost sharing. Currently, while both the County and officers benefit from the take-home policy, the County bears the cost of the program. This division of costs reduces the incentive for staff to live close to where they work and could be one of the reasons we found commute mileage is such a large percentage of total vehicle mileage. We estimate that commuting annually represents more than six million miles, or 56%, of the total miles driven by KCSO officers in county-owned vehicles. We make a number of recommendations in this report to improve both the transparency and operations of the current program, including having KCSO develop a plan to more accurately track off-duty work by its officers and take steps to ensure it is collecting reimbursements from employers for use of county-owned vehicles. We also recommend that the County Executive, in consultation with the King County Sheriff's Office, assess options to more equitably share the costs of commuting with KCSO employees with assigned vehicles.",

Not all reviewed jurisdictions developed a formal strategic plan, but usually have in place a two-tier system of goals. Top tier goals and priorities are identified with formal input from the community and have a longer timeframe than the second tier goals. The budget documents highlight the goals and strategies and connect elements of the budget to performance measures at the strategy, initiative, goals, or department level. Several jurisdictions use some version of zero-based budgeting to prioritize or evaluate programs and services. Retreats are used by the legislative body, sometimes in connection with the executive branch, as a mechanism to deepen its understanding of issues, trends, and priorities, and translate that knowledge into goals, priorities, measures, or target. The legislative branch employs different methods to engage in oversight of the performance management system: e.g., participation on goal-level performance forums; creation of a legislative sub-committee for each of the organization's goals; and participation, along with the executive branch, and occasionally stakeholders, on a committee appointed to provide oversight or evaluation. Timing the goal setting process with election cycles increases buy-in and sustainability, as does providing systematic training to newly elected officials on the performance management system. An integrated data management system can increase buy-in throughout the organization, sustainability of the process, and transparency. Formally appointed groups of citizens, subject matter experts, or a mix of internal and external stakeholders, provide advice and perspective at the strategic or goal-level planning levels and can play an important role in helping the government identify potential issues, while also increasing transparency. No formal recommendations were made for this review.",

EHS received revenues of $20.4 million in 2012 from permit fees. The purpose of this audit was to understand the costs and the process that drive the fees from a permit holder perspective, while looking for opportunities for efficiencies and cost containment. We also followed up on recommendations made to EHS in an audit by our office in 2008. In response to a loss of revenue from the recent recession, EHS reduced costs and introduced efficiencies in the permitting process. These actions in conjunction with the recent fee increases have resulted in fee revenue exceeding the full costs of providing inspection services. This raises concern about fee equity and compliance with state requirements that fees not exceed actual costs. Without a strategic or financial plan to align financial polices with organization objectives, EHS lacks guidance on how to ensure that fees do not exceed the cost of inspections, or that some program fees do not subsidize the costs of providing inspection services to other programs. EHS has begun efforts to add rigor to the fee setting process. However, more actions on the part of EHS and the Board of Health are needed to achieve equity among the fees that permit holders pay, including re-examining the data and assumptions EHS uses in calculating hourly rates and fund balance reserve needs. Also, EHS has not employed a rigorous approach when making staff allocation decisions that demonstrate it is aligning staffing resources to inspection workloads. Finally, on average, King County's food program permit fees are higher than five of the six jurisdictions we surveyed. Three recommendations in this report will improve strategic planning, financial planning, and the fee-setting process to address the equity issues that arise from fees not aligning with costs. Two other recommendations call for EHS to update and validate the assumptions it uses for setting rates and to follow best practices in determining staffing needs.",

Key audit findings included: --EMS's overhead increased by 51 percent primarily due to changes in the County's distribution methodology. --Overhead charges to EMS and its programs generally represented benefits received, but equity could be improved in a few cases. --EMS took steps to enhance the accountability, transparency, and cost-effectiveness of its Strategic Initiatives Program by developing and reporting on some performance measures. --EMS did not quantify financial benefits for several of the strategic initiatives prior to expanding them into regional services. --EMS managed the 2012 EMS levy in compliance with the council-adopted financial plan. To improve the equity of overhead distribution, we recommend that Public Health merge the Consolidated Contract Oversight category into the Accounting, Budget, and Financial Services category and EMS include the King County Medic One Program in distributing Facilities Management overhead charges. In addition, we recommended that EMS continue to take steps to quantify and report the financial benefits of strategic initiatives intended to contain costs or gain efficiencies.",

FMD forecasts that it can still deliver the project for the total approved budget of $212 million. The project oversight committee recently approved moving ahead with the design and construction of the Alder Academy, but not the shell and core of the two additional courthouse floors. FMD has set the baseline scope of this project including one major addition to the Council-approved design-build contract, the Alder Academy. The source of funding for this recent addition, estimated to cost $2.9 million is uncertain. The shell and core of two additional courthouse floors are not included in the baseline scope.FMD has set the baseline schedule showing completion of the courthouse and detention building moved out approximately nine months from the project schedule prior to execution of the design build contract, due to a longer procurement period and more realistic review time to obtain permits from the City of Seattle. The courthouse and detention building is forecast to open early in 2019. Demolition of the existing structures, construction of the new parking garage, and final site work is scheduled to be done by April 2020, eight months later than the previous schedule.The baseline budget was set at $212 million, the appropriation amount approved by the County Council as the budget. It does not include the cost of Alder Academy; doing so would require additional budget appropriation. Despite FMD's work to control costs, schedule delays and other known risks could result in use of approximately half of the project contingency before construction. FMD is pursuing cost-saving design changes and evaluating whether the remaining contingency is adequate. Some changes deviate from contract specifications or may impact surplus county property and may need approval from the County Council. We make recommendations that FMD seek appropriation authority from the County Council for the Alder Academy prior to moving beyond design of the additional scope. We also make recommendations to facilitate accountability and transparency on this and future capital projects.",

The revised Ordinance will apply cost limits to all projects under the Ordinance and change the goal for LEED certification from Gold to Platinum. King County is committed to responsible environmental stewardship; however, the current implementation of the Green Building Ordinance may not fully leverage its intended impacts. Among the county's initiatives, several related to the Green Building Ordinance are noteworthy, such as the creation of a Green Building Team, centralized project reporting, the provision of training in sustainable practices, and promoting the use of life cycle cost analysis.King County's leadership in responding to climate change depends on its ability to proactively guide green building project managers in making cost-effective decisions that contribute to achieving countywide climate action goals. A key finding of this performance audit is that ambiguity in the Ordinance, coupled with how limits in LEED costs have been established, may lead to outcomes unanticipated by policy-makers and contrary to the intent of promoting cost-effective sustainable development. These outcomes may include foregoing the pursuit of some green building alternatives that may be environmentally beneficial and financially responsible. In addition, incomplete reporting and inconsistent interpretation of key elements of the Ordinance make it difficult to assess program impact. Our recommendations focus on clarifying requirements in the Ordinance and ensuring better project tracking, reporting, and alignment with countywide sustainability goals. The report also offers an alternative for setting limits to LEED-associated costs that would be consistent among projects.",

We sought to identify ways King County could more effectively use part-time employees, and what information is necessary to improve current policies. This audit coincides with King County's review of a number of long-standing employment practices and its attempt to overhaul and modernize the personnel system as part of its Employer of the Future initiative. In many instances, King County uses part-time workers effectively for business purposes, but the lack of flexibility in county policies may limit opportunities for employees interested in voluntary part-time work. Given the low number of voluntary part-time workers and the advantages to both the County and employees from part-time work, increased use of part-time schedules may present opportunities for greater productivity and increased employee retention. Changing access to part time as well as the benefits costs associated with such work may involve amending the county charter and could result in unintended consequences such as reducing the availability of part-time workers. About 10 percent of King County's 13,000 employees work part time, mainly as part-time transit operators. Almost all part-time employees work half time or more, thus receive the same benefits as full-time employees - at a cost of about $16,000 per employee in 2014. We make two recommendations to improve the amount of information available regarding part-time employment and to provide guidance to county managers and departments regarding its use. Human resources management tools can be better utilized to gather data on employee interest and participation in part-time work.

This audit of the Georgetown CSO project focuses on how the Wastewater Treatment Division manages projects in the early development phase when significant cost growth has occurred on CSO projects in the past. WTD is experienced in managing large capital projects and follows some best practices. However, WTD selected wet weather treatment as the final alternative for controlling sewer overflows in the Georgetown area based on imprecise cost estimates and insufficient analysis of other alternatives. Early indications are that costs are likely to grow substantially for the Georgetown project. Further, the alternative WTD selected for the Georgetown project presents inherent risks that could add substantially to project costs. These issues raise significant questions about whether WTD selected a cost-effective alternative. WTD's planning-level cost estimation process needs improvement and King County faces potentially significant increases on projects in its CSO program, including the Georgetown project. For instance, project costs on four ongoing CSO projects have grown by 47 to 533 percent since WTD provided planning-level cost estimates to decision-makers. If final costs for projects in the 2012 CSO Control Plan exceed planning-level estimates by the same margin, the total cost of the program could be approximately $2.6 billion, substantially higher than the $711 million program cost presented in the 2012 CSO Control Plan. Projects specified in King County's CSO consent decree with the Department of Justice were selected based on less analysis than is typical for projects of this magnitude. However, it may be possible to modify the terms of the consent decree to increase project benefits and reduce project costs. To help ensure cost-effective action on the part of WTD, we recommend that WTD conduct additional analysis of alternatives for controlling sewer overflows and create performance measures and other mechanisms for better controlling project cost growth during early project development phases.",

Lastly, while this is a large and complex project requiring a great deal of communication and coordination among the four partners, we found instances in the project management approach and documentation in which the risk mitigation and communication strategies were not consistent with the overall magnitude of the radio replacement project thus increasing overall project risk.

            "Highlights": "King County has invested $117 million in the Major Maintenance Reserve Fund to provide for the maintenance and repair of county buildings in the past 15 years. We reviewed the financing, management, and implementation of the Facilities Management Division's major maintenance program to determine whether this investment has effectively provided for the county's major maintenance needs. The idea of pre-funding major maintenance to reduce spikes in maintenance spending is a good one; however, there are opportunities to more effectively implement this concept. Despite stipulation in King County Code that the fund be fully financed, it received only 34 percent of the funds needed to perform major maintenance between 2002 and 2010. The backlog of critical work required before 2016 is about $100 million, and consequences of this backlog could begin to affect county operations. For example, the electrical system in the King County Courthouse is far past its intended life span and could fail at any time, rendering the building unusable. The Facilities Management Division should proactively approach funding limitations by taking advantage of opportunities to effectively communicate the extent of major maintenance needs. The financial model the division has been using to predict major maintenance costs contains flaws that render its predictions unreliable. In addition, because the division has not adequately tracked building condition, it is unable to measure the impact of major maintenance spending decisions. We recommend that the division improve data collection and tracking methods and strengthen communication with decision-makers to enable them to make strategic decisions about major maintenance funding. It should also ensure that its revised financial model accurately predicts the full cost of major maintenance for buildings in the Major Maintenance Reserve Fund portfolio. In addition, we recommend that the County Executive and County Council set target building condition levels for the division to use in measuring and reporting the performance of the major maintenance program.",

King County has been a national leader in local climate change policy. The 2012 SCAP was a significant achievement that facilitated communication and collaboration among county departments promoting environmental sustainability.Despite this achievement, King County will likely not be able to reach its ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction goals unless the climate program is strengthened. While the SCAP provides a thorough summary of current county efforts to reduce climate pollution and improve climate resilience, it does not provide a clear roadmap to show what steps are necessary to meet the county's climate goals. Additionally, the SCAP lacks information about the potential costs and impacts associated with the county's efforts and how the community as a whole should be engaged to reach the goals.The upcoming 2015 SCAP update provides an important opportunity to strengthen current efforts and enhance the ability of the County to achieve its goals through improved strategic planning, economic analysis, and community engagement. Our recommendations focus on improving the SCAP by incorporating best practices in strategic planning such as greater community engagement, clearer linkages between strategies and goals, and increased use of economic analysis to drive decision-making and evaluate performance. In addition, we recommend that policy-makers put a management structure for the plan update process in place and provide sufficient resources and support.",

The County Executive has proposed changes to how the County administers family and medical leave. Our review focused on how these changes would simplify leave administration and what challenges may remain. In doing so, we also reviewed the county's family and medical leave management structures and the consistency of family and medical leave processes among county departments. Family and medical leave is complex and difficult to administer. An executive proposal to modify King County Family and Medical Leave (KCFML) will likely address some administrative challenges and create efficiencies; however, significant issues will remain. For example, departments will continue to need to use side systems to track family and medical leave. Gaps in guidance and training, weaknesses in data systems, and the county's decentralized approach to family and medical leave administration continue to present challenges. As a result, administration of family and medical leave is inefficient, inconsistent, and may result in improper use of leave. Ultimately, accurate and efficient administration of family and medical leave depends on close coordination of federal, state, and local requirements with the county's management processes. We recommend that the County Executive take steps to ensure the consistency and accuracy of family and medical leave time reporting. These steps may include improvements to timekeeping data entry processes and time tracking systems, consistent and comprehensive training, and education to employees regarding family and medical leave. These changes will help ensure that employees are using the amount of family and medical leave to which they are entitled, while providing greater predictability and ease of administration to employees, supervisors, and county management. Further, we recommend that the County Executive follow through with his proposal to resolve the administrative challenges presented by the differences between KCFML requirements and similar federal and state regulations.",

King County's Office of Law Enforcement Oversight (OLEO) and the Sheriff's Internal Investigations Unit (IIU) are intended to work jointly to ensure that complaints of misconduct involving Sheriff's Office employees are properly investigated. In addition, OLEO has the authority to make systemic recommendations to improve Sheriff's Office operations. This audit of law enforcement oversight focuses on the system currently in place in King County and identifies structural impediments and other barriers to success. We consulted experts in the fields of law enforcement oversight and labor negotiations, including conducting both a survey and an expert panel, to inform our findings and recommendations. The system of civilian oversight currently in place in King County has limited authority compared to other oversight functions across the United States. In addition, there are significant barriers in place that undermine OLEO's independence and access to information--elements that are critical to its success. For instance, restrictions prevent OLEO from downloading and/or printing documents related to complaints and investigations, and a contract provision allows OLEO's access to these files to be cut off. This limits OLEO's access to information, making it difficult for OLEO to provide meaningful oversight. There are also problems with the way law enforcement oversight is set up that threaten the independence of oversight. Notably, OLEO operations are defined by the terms of labor contracts. Consequently, OLEO's processes and authority are defined by those it oversees, creating a conflict of interest that cannot be easily resolved. To ensure effective law enforcement oversight, we recommend that the County Sheriff and the County Executive provide OLEO with unrestricted access to information and take several steps to cement the independence of both OLEO and IIU. We also present multiple options for addressing structural impediments to OLEO's authority contained in existing labor agreements. Experts and stakeholders agree that many topics contained in the labor agreement may be more appropriately addressed in King County Code, but potential solutions are complex and will require collaboration among multiple parties with sometimes opposing interests.

            "Highlights": "This audit of light duty fleets aligns closely with King County Executive and Council policy priorities of fiscal responsibility and environmental impact. The county owns about 1700 light duty vehicles and spent more than $13 million on these vehicles in 2013. The audit focuses on how agencies make decisions related to the size and composition of their light duty fleet to best meet strategic goals. Many vehicles are being driven fewer miles than required by the county's minimum use policy, which is intended to rightsize the county fleet. The cost-efficiency of vehicles can also be measured by how much time a vehicle is in use or by the contribution of the car to county business needs, but decision-makers currently lack consistent data in these areas, which hampers efforts to ensure the most economic fleet size. As a result, fleet costs may be higher than necessary to provide reasonable transportation options for employees who travel to conduct county business. Fleet Administration customers are using less fuel than in the past, but reducing idling by King County Sheriff patrol vehicles is key to further reductions in total county fuel use. Patrol cars use about the same amount of fuel per year idling as the total amount of fuel used by all other Fleet customers combined. In addition, a lack of consistent and accurate data on fuel consumption prevents decision-makers from realizing potential efficiency gains and ensuring progress toward environmental goals. Finally, we determined that the lack of cost analysis when making high-risk vehicle purchasing decisions may contribute to higher-cost fleet selections. We make seven recommendations to help decision-makers achieve county strategic goals through optimization of fleet size and vehicle performance. Recommendations touch on automating and enhancing vehicle data, making thorough utilization decisions, evaluating car-sharing options, reducing idle time, and rigorous evaluation of vehicle costs prior to purchases.",

King County and its PSAP partners are in the process of implementing Next Generation 911, a national initiative aimed at modernizing and improving the capabilities of the 911 system. The King County Council included a proviso in its 2015-2016 budget for the Auditor's Office to conduct a financial and technical audit of King County's 911 system. King County has been a national leader in updating and enhancing its 911 system. However, it anticipates the program will run out of money within the next three years and it faces a number of other challenges in its current efforts to implement Next Generation 911 services. The lack of an effective governance structure that includes King County and its PSAP partners is the most serious of these challenges. Because of this, while solutions exist for many of the financial and technical challenges that we identify in our report, there is currently no formal means for King County and its partners to make decisions. We also found that King County has not consistently followed its own guidelines and process for managing information technology projects. We recommend that King County temporarily suspend its implementation of Next Generation 911 until this governance issue can be resolved. In addition, we make recommendations to help King County and its partners move forward with implementation of Next Generation 911.

Based on the interest by the County Council and as a continuation of our work on King County's Transfer Station System, this review evaluates the analysis done by the Solid Waste Division in its 2015 Transfer Plan Report. The service times and queue lengths described in the report represent conditions for less than two percent of customers. However, even using these assumptions, SWD's report concludes that available mitigation strategies could reduce demand during peak times to acceptable levels without a new northeast transfer station. --Diversion of tonnage and transactions from the Houghton Transfer Station are key to whether worst-case scenarios will actually occur. SWD's report assumes that 90 percent of current Houghton customers will go to the Factoria Transfer Station. Directing customers to closer stations with greater capacity or keeping Houghton open at least for weekend self-haul customers could reduce the service times and queue lengths assumed in the report. --More precise impact and cost analysis of mitigation strategies could provide policy-makers with additional options to avoid the predicted 'worst-case scenarios.' There is significant risk associated with building a new transfer station now, as it would obligate the County to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build and operate a facility that may not be needed. Although the current forecast appears reasonably reliable, SWD has overestimated long-range tonnage in its past forecasts. This uncertainty around future tonnage reiterates why it makes sense to pursue alternatives to building a new transfer station as decisions about how to implement mitigation strategies can be made closer to the projected peak year when there will be greater certainty about tonnage. While the report includes analysis of several mitigation strategies, some were evaluated using limited data, and other options were not evaluated; therefore, we make a recommendation for SWD to test the impact and reassess the costs of some strategies.",

Transit has spent about $12 million annually on the maintenance of its facilities, but estimates that expenditures will need to increase by 50%, to more than $18 million annually for the next five years to keep its facilities in a state of good repair. If Transit is unable to keep its facilities in a state of good repair, it could create a large backlog of necessary maintenance work, leading to tens of millions of dollars in increased maintenance costs and eventually a negative impact on transit services. While Transit has been a leading agency in maintaining its facilities, it must make changes to address increasing maintenance workload, as well as improve transparency and accountability of the TAMP projects. Transit has effectively assessed building conditions and budgeted funds for maintenance activities; however, there are barriers in terms of project management, IT systems, reporting, and planning. Transit does not have a consistent record of completing planned asset maintenance work and will likely miss its 2015 target. In addition, Transit's practice of using one master project to plan and report on TAMP subprojects limits information available to decision-makers and could lead to excessive budgeting. We make recommendations to improve the execution and oversight of Transit's capital asset maintenance projects.

We have identified schedule and cost risks to King County's $273 million levy funded Puget Sound Emergency Radio Network (PSERN) project. The purpose of this voter approved effort is to upgrade King County's emergency radio network to meet modern technology standards, expand coverage, and replace existing equipment. The current network vendor (Motorola) has stated it will stop supplying replacement parts and repairing used parts for equipment at the end of 2018, resulting in a risk of performance degradation thereafter. The PSERN project team has contracted with Motorola to identify radio tower sites and furnish, install, and test a new emergency radio system and equipment at a cost of $112 million, with final acceptance scheduled for September 2020.The construction portion of the project scope is uncertain, with locations for six radio tower sites to be determined and further evaluation needed to confirm the usability of 14 other sites.Over half of the sites identified by Motorola have not been usable, delaying the county's leasing, design, and construction work since replacement sites had to be located before these tasks could start.The current project budget for designing, leasing, and constructing radio tower sites is based on planning-level estimates prepared in 2013. It has not been revised to reflect what PSERN has learned through early lease negotiations and design activities on usable sites.

Long-term forecasts of customer rates provide guidance to the County Council when considering major capital improvement programs proposed by the agencies, as major capital programs can have a significant impact on future rates. The purpose of this audit was to assess the accuracy of long-term rate forecasts by these agencies and identify the reasons for any inaccuracies. While Solid Waste and Wastewater follow many best practices in their long-term forecasting, past forecasts have underestimated future rate increases. This is particularly true for Wastewater's capacity charge, which is levied on new connections to the wastewater system. The current capacity charge is about 10 times higher than was forecast in the 1999 Regional Wastewater Services Plan Operational Master Plan. There is a great deal of uncertainty associated with long-term rate forecasts, and neither agency presented future rates as a range of possible outcomes in order to reflect this uncertainty. We recommend that Solid Waste and Wastewater conduct sensitivity analysis around key assumptions, and present long-term rate forecasts in a range of possible rate outcomes. We will be conducting a second phase of this audit to review Wastewater's rates model in detail. Wastewater's rates model is very complex, and the second phase of the audit will review the logic and calculations of the model to ensure that its outputs are consistent with county policies. The Auditor's Office performed a similar review of Solid Waste's rates model in the past.",

            "Highlights": "Transit's Component Supply Center (CSC) performs specialized maintenance activities and, by rebuilding parts, has the potential to save money. However, a 2014 peer review by the American Public Transportation Association raised concerns about how decisions are made at the CSC and suggested that its resources could be better utilized. This audit assessed how Transit decides to make or buy bus and trolley parts, and the extent to which it has the structure in place to ensure that the most cost-effective decisions are being made. CSC can demonstrate examples of how its expertise results in substantial cost savings. However, data reliability issues, the shortcomings in King County Transit's Rebuild Cost Estimating policy, and CSC's lack of adherence to the policy raise questions about whether CSC is rebuilding parts that would be less costly to procure elsewhere, or buying new parts that would be less costly to rebuild. This is of particular concern with respect to the potential to buy externally-rebuilt parts, because little effort is made to compare the cost of internal rebuilds to external rebuilds. CSC's full potential is not being realized because of labor provisions and a lack of planning. With labor negotiations taking place in 2016 and a significant shift in its workforce over the next five years, Transit has a unique opportunity to plan, collaborate, and resolve issues with inefficiencies. Doing so in a thoughtful way can ensure that CSC is better prepared for future needs, and that its activities generate the most value to the county. We recommend that Transit improve and enforce policies related to the make vs. buy decision, improve the reliability of performance data, conduct planning aimed at improving how CSC resources are allocated, and work with labor to improve flexibility over resource allocation.",
